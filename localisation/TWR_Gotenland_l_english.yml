RGO_commercial_use_of_helicopters_desc:0 "Perhaps we can actually make money out of our new helicopters, as our tourism board suggests. Many would-be tourists would be willing to pay a lot of Reichsmarks to fly over our gorgeous skies and beaches. We should take advantage of this!"

RGO_nuclear_power_for_civic_use_desc:0 "Nuclear power can be used for much more than just weapons of war, we can use Uranium-powered energy plants to electrify thousands and even millions of homes with the right equipment. We should realize the dream of nuclear energy to further boost the economy."

RGO_national_bunker_system_desc:0 "It is not unlikely that Gotenland is stricken by the detonation of one or more enemy nuclear weapons, and as such our people must be prepared to shelter from atomic hellscape.

RGO_gotische_heer:0 "고틀란트 육군"
RGO_gotische_heer_desc:0 "Gotenland is no doubt the jewel of the SS. In order to keep it that way, we will need to re-examine our policy with the military. On the one hand, we could expand our purview and recruit a less "elite" army, but allow us to expand our numbers.

RGO_civic_defense_program_desc:0 "We sadly cannot expect everyone to, at all times, be conscripted into our ranks. We can, however, require a less formal, more civilian "defense program". This would not only bolster our military numerically, but also train for urban resistance in case of invasion."
RGO_unshakable_will:0 "흔들리지 않는 의지"
RGO_unshakable_will_desc:0 "Remember the basics. We are Germans. The decadence and docile lifestyle of outsiders may serve their hedonistic will, however Gotenland will stand apart. We must never forget who we are. Should war befall our little project, we must be ready to win by any means necessary. Perhaps propaganda will encourage our citizens."
RGO_totaler_krieg:0 "총력전"
RGO_totaler_krieg_desc:0 "The sword is, in fact, mightier than the pen. In case of war, we cannot forsake this. Rally our citizens, stir their hearts, and prepare them for nothing short of total war. We will defend every inch of Gotenland with our lives."
RGO_auxiliary_integration:0 "보조 인원 통합"
RGO_auxiliary_integration_desc:0 "Though our standing army is strong, it is lacking in numbers. Perhaps to nullify this issue, we should consider merging citizen-formed military units into the army.

RGO_formalize_the_volkssturm:0 "국민돌격대 조직"
RGO_formalize_the_volkssturm_desc:0 "The Volkssturm was a good idea, and certainly helped keep our citizens in line. However, our lacking military makes it necessary to take this rag-tag team of average Germans and equip them with top grade gear and armor."

RGO_unbreakable_lines_desc:0 "Our borders are small and will not require much to fortify. Economically, it should not be an issue. They are lacking in the defense department, and in order to sustain Gotenland from outside degeneracy, we must wall off our border with bunkers and trenches."
RGO_fortress_mentality:0 "요새같은 정신"
RGO_fortress_mentality_desc:0 "Though we have fortified Gotenland literally, we also need to do so figuratively. We have, generally, inspired the people. We could always use more, though, and it's time to instill a "do or die" attitude into our population. We fight to the last man!"
RGO_an_elite_force:0 "엘리트 부대"
RGO_an_elite_force_desc:0 "Perhaps that instead of making a large, conscripted army, we focus on having a smaller manpower pool that is more selective. That way, we can have more elite strikeforces defending our interests."
RGO_panzergrenadiers:0 "기갑척탄병"
RGO_panzergrenadiers_desc:0 "They were used during the War, and they proved successful then. In order to protect our small amount of troops, we should equip them with armored vehicles. This way, they can not only be protected when transporting but also move quicker."
RGO_infantry_supports_armor:0 "보병의 전차 지원"
RGO_infantry_supports_armor_desc:0 "To make up for our smaller army size, we should put an emphasis on vehicles such as tanks to make up for it.

RGO_modern_mechanized_designs:0 "현대 기계화 설계"
RGO_modern_mechanized_designs_desc:0 "Though we may have highly trained troops and armor, it is nothing if it is comprised of the dated armor of the past. To rectify this, we need to develop cutting edge technology to effectively enforce our new doctrine."

RGO_clear_land_for_industrial_use_desc:0 "In order to implement them, we need to produce the necessary equipment. while Gotenland is geographically small, there is still land that we can clear for industrial use.

RGO_military_industry:0 "군수산업"
RGO_military_industry_desc:0 "Other nations may feed their indulgences by using their workforce to produce materiel goods, but we reject such debauchery. We should be putting industry to use for the military, not for frivolous commodities. It's time to show the world the power of our war machine."
RGO_truck_factories:0 "트럭 공장"
RGO_truck_factories_desc:0 "Tanks and armored cars are great for our military industry, but we will need some civilian use after all. So, why not the best of both world and begin pumping out trucks? These can be sold both as a civilian vehicle and a military transport. The most bang for your buck."
RGO_heavy_vehicle_factories:0 "중형차량 공장"
RGO_heavy_vehicle_factories_desc:0 "We have our industry spread to cater to a wide variety of military demands. We should dedicate a portion of that to heavy vehicles in order to keep with the times."
RGO_zukunftspanzer:0 "현대전차"
RGO_zukunftspanzer_desc:0 "Everything has been leading up to this, the next step in military design. The brightest minds of the SS and the German race as a whole have dedicated months to this. Finally, we can roll out the next generation in vehicle design. Cutting edge, futuristic tanks that operate as killing machines will change warfare forever."

RGO_Gotisch_Politics:0 "고틀란트 정치"
RGO_Gotisch_Politics_desc:0 "Gotic politics have long been dominated by slightly tweaked version of the \"Führerprinzip\" like the one that reigns so long in Berlin, now Germania, here with Reinhard Heydrich the Reichsführer SS most trusted being at the helm of the nation in every sense of the word. Nigh every decision going through Heydrich's circle of advisors and favored. \n\nNow the fair beast hungers for more...and we shall provide."
RGO_Fall_Of_Third_Reich:0 "제국의 몰락"
RGO_Fall_Of_Third_Reich_desc:0 "For years we have laid low, for years we have endured. Now the time to strike has come. With Germania in flames it is now time to begin our true work. Unshackled from the degeneracy of the Reichs labyrinthine bureaucracy and excesses of Göring and Speer we shall create a true Aryan state here in Gotenland. May it reign untarnished for a thousand years to come!"
RGO_Independent_Gotenland:0 "독립 고틀란트"
RGO_Independent_Gotenland_desc:0 "For Gotenland to be strong it must be free of degeneracy that has once more befallen the Reich. We shall make sure that no official that holds any degree of loyalty to Germania remains in the halls of power and no worker that does the same remains on the streets."
RGO_Expand_Gotische_Claims:0 "영유권 확대"
RGO_Expand_Gotische_Claims_desc:0 "With Gotenland now free we are free to act in any way we wish. It is time to grow Gotenland to the true glory it deserves. Not one dictated by an aging man on an alabaster throne far away but the will of the leader of a horde of perfect Aryan specimen."
RGO_True_Aryan_State:0 "진정한 아리아 국가"
RGO_True_Aryan_State_desc:0 "Thanks to Hitler's folly the Reich has once more been plagued by foreign degeneracy, twisted beyond recognition from its glorious beginnings. But not all is lost. Despite the excesses of the leeches at his side the Führer will rest easy knowing that at least one true Aryan state remains in the world. \n\nWe."
RGO_Loyalist_Exiles:0 "충성스러운 망명자들"
RGO_Loyalist_Exiles_desc:0 "With the civil war raging a few loyal sons of the Reichsführer SS became prodigal, cast out against their will and more importantly unable to complete their sacred duty to the twin lightning. Yet their talents are still needed, we shall for the time forgive their failure and welcome them warmly into our ranks."
RGO_Attract_German_Refugees:0 "독일 난민 초청"
RGO_Attract_German_Refugees_desc:0 "Thousands flee the Reich weekly from the raging civil war. While most are either feeble civilians or traitorous degenerates a few are those still holding the true Aryan spirit within them. We shall offer them refuge and reward so they may strengthen the future stronghold of true national socialism."
RGO_Urbanize_Gotenland:0 "고틀란트 도시화"
RGO_Urbanize_Gotenland_desc:0 "With the tide of flesh flooding Gotenland we need brick and cement to house them all.

RGO_Proclaim_The_Gotsiche_Reich:0 "고트제국 선언"
RGO_Proclaim_The_Gotsiche_Reich_desc:0 "With the true Aryan once more being free to shape the world in his image it is time to repeat history. Like the original Reichsgründung in 1871 under Bismarck we shall proclaim the \"Gotenreich\", the true Reich of the Aryan race and become a master befitting of Europe for all time! \n\nHEIL HEYDRICH!"
RGO_Ukraine_Raids:0 "우크라이나인 사냥"
RGO_Ukraine_Raids_desc:0 "The Untermensch is especially despicable in the territory that once was called Ukraine. With the current Reichskommissar being unable to properly show the subhuman their place it is time once more to assert our supremacy of Europe now...and one day the world."
RGO_Gotische_Oil_Raids:0 "석유 도둑"
RGO_Gotische_Oil_Raids_desc:0 "The christians god in his magnanimity said that the meek shall one day inherit the earth. Yet the false god never accounted for the mighty.

RGO_Oil_Stockpile:0 "석유 비축분"
RGO_Oil_Stockpile_desc:0 "The coming years will be tough. Many conflicts to come and more to endure. For this we need a modern army.  A modern army hungers for oil. We shall nourish it plentifully."

RGO_gotische_tourism_industry_desc:0 "Gotenland was designated as the German paradise on the Black Sea's coast.

twrgotenland.1.d:0 "고틀란트, 동유럽에 위치한 독일 슈츠슈타펠의 식민지입니다. 라인하르트 하이드리히에게 배정된 과거 크림이라고 불렸던 땅으로써, 그는 고틀란트를 아리아인의 천국으로 만드는 임무를 부여받았습니다. 하이드리히는 3년만에 옛인구의 '제거'와 열성적인 독일 정착민들의 재정착을 도와 일을 완벽하게 해냈습니다. 크림이라는 말은 이제 먼 과거의 단어입니다. 고틀란트는 게르마니아와 다를바 없고, 라인하르트 하이드리히를 숭배하고 제국의 관광과 선전을 맡은 자율적인 지역입니다."
twrgotenland.1.a:0 "고틀란트와 하이드리히를 위하여!"

twrgermangotenland.1.t:0 "고틀란트 강화""
twrgermangotenland.1.d:0 "총통께서는 고틀란트로 증원, 보급, 식민지 개척자들의 지원을 약속했습니다. 이제 인력과 산업원조를 받아 독일의 새로운 보석인 고틀란트는 번창할 것입니다!"

twrgotenland.55.a:0 "망할!"

twrgotenland.54.t:0 "차디찬 손"
twrgotenland.54.d:0 "고틀란트의 교리인 죽음의 손, 죽은자의 손은 차갑고 잔인하며, 용서하거나 잊지 않습니다. 하지만 죽은자의 손은 모든 것을 포용합니다."

twrgotenland.51.t:0 "Black Sea Helicopter Tour"
twrgotenland.51.d:0 "With the latest experimental helicopters imported directly from the black market, Gotenland will organise Black Sea Helicopter Tours, for our tourists to enjoy. Though there are concerns about the reliability and usefulness of such a new technology for civilian use, this will surely be a great attraction to our tourism industry, and will be a great investment for the economy as a whole."

twrgotenland.50.t:0 "Formation of the G.Lufthansa"

twrgotenland.3.d:0 "Helmut Christain Goebbels, son of Joseph Goebbels, has arrived in Gotenland for vacation. This trip was unannounced and shocked the leadership of Gotenland. Reinhard Heydrich greeted Helmut who arrived to Gotenland on an armoured train via the Europa Trainline, offering Helmut a state sponsored trip throughout hotspots and legendary Gotische sites within Gotenland. \n\nHowever, the true goals of the sponsored trip are well hidden within Heydrich's mind."

twrgotenland.31.d:0 "After a grand show of force and manipulation, Helmut Goebbels was fascinated by the achievements of Gotenland and her Schutzstaffel rulers.

This is a massive blow to Gotenland's prestige as a model colony, and Gotenland's image among the high circles of Germania might be ruined."

twrgotenland.33.t:0 "Helmut Impressed"
